# Exercise 1.3: 

## Question:
Greedy Play Suppose the reinforcement learning player was greedy, that is, it always played the move that brought it to the position that it rated the best. Might it learn to play better, or worse, than a nongreedy player? What problems might occur?

## Answer:
Generally it should learn to play better than a nongreedy player. Because greedy algorithms focus on short-term reward, it may leads to a local maximum value. I think a well-designed value function can help to jump out the local maximum value.
