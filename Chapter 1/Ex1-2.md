# Exercise 1.2: 

## Question:
Symmetries Many tic-tac-toe positions appear different but are really the same because of symmetries. How might we amend the learning process described above to take advantage of this? In what ways would this change improve the learning process? Now think again. Suppose the opponent did not take advantage of symmetries. In that case, should we? Is it true, then, that symmetrically equivalent positions should necessarily have the same value?

## Answer:
We can add a preprocessing step to use symmetry. For example, we can rotate the chessboard to make the first move is near to the left-bottom point. Using symmetry can tremendously reduce the search space, which will make the algorithm faster and smarter. If the opponent did not use this, we can use this advantage to beat him, techically yes. If using symmetry, the symmetrically equivalent position should have same value.
